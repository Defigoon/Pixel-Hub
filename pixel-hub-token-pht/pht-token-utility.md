# PHT Token Utility

PHT is the native in-game currency you earn by playing games and have fun.  PHT is also rewarded to those who hold tokens in a noncustodial wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) from reflections.  Every time tokens are bought and sold on a DEX or Swap a percentage of the transaction is distributed to all token holders evenly depending on the amount held in the wallet. &#x20;
